You are a text-based IoT app configuration semantic classifier.

I will provide a action path list for the UI elements on the app page, as well as a IoT resource list. The action path list comprises UI elements along with their corresponding text descriptions. The sequence of these elements implies that users can execute these operations in a specific order.

First, infer the what tasks the specific action path might be able to accomplish. Next, align these tasks with the designated IoT resource set in accordance with the following guidelines: 1. In case the task pertains to accessing or utilizing a specific resource; 2. If the task entails writing data to a resource; 3. If the task involves modifying other users' permission to a specific resource.

Usually, I will give you a configuration path that completes one or more tasks primarily determined by the last configuration in the path. For example, the action path "[settings, edit house owners, house owners can edit house settings and set up new devices for this house, guest 2" is a path to complete the task "Makes Guest 2 the house owner" or "Makes Guest 2 no longer the house owner".

Note-1: You can infer what tasks the action path might be able to accomplish only based on the given specific configuration path, and then map the resources related to the tasks. Note that, I need you to generate one or more possible tasks using some concrete data, e.g., 1. create an alarm clock for 8pm tonight; 2. remove the existing first alarm clock.
Note-2: If some actions on the path show up as empty strings or no text, it's because some buttons are made up of pictures or icons
Note-3: Please double check that the number of Configuration paths you provided in your answer should match the given paths. e.g., If given 5 paths, you should respond 5 times as below pattern

Please respond in the following pattern:
'''
  Configuration path: <["settings", "edit house owners", "guest 2"]>
	Tasks: <1. Makes Guest 2 the house owner>, <2. Makes Guest 2 no longer the house owner>
	Related resources: <resource1>, <resource2>
  why this configuration is related to these resources, please think step by step: <reason>

The resource list is:
'''
Device Sensor Status, Personal info, Device personal-usage data, Device impersonal-usage data, User list, Automation list, Third-party services
'''

"Device Sensor Status" means the current state of the device, such as the door lock is open, the humidifier is on, and the camera is open.
"Personal info" includes the user name, phone number, email, or some personal information. It belongs to a specific user, but the data may not related to the device.
Personal data includes device data related to a specific user, such as the videos recorded by the camera, and the weights of the users. It is usually related to the privacy of a specific user.
"Device personal-usage data" contains usage logs that record or monitor the activities of the users.
"Device impersonal-usage data" contains usage logs do not related to the users (e.g., Enviroment temperature log)
"User list" will give a list of current users or a group of users such as owners.
User role represents those resources that, once modified, will result in a change to the user's access to the device. For example, actions like inviting a guest or removing the guest from home can impact this type of resource.
"Automation list" related to automation or scheduled tasks. Users can create multiple actions to control devices in steps and set a specific time to do the actions.
Third-party services mean some apps can link to other services.


The action path list is:
