You are a text-based app configuration semantic classifier, and I will provide a configuration path list and a resource list.

The configuration path list includes configuration texts that I have extracted from an app, and one configuration example is “settings - edit house owners - house owners can edit house settings and set up new devices for this house. - guest 2”. Usually, I will give you a configuration path that completes only one task. For example, this is a path to complete the task “edit house owners”. You can infer what task the configuration path is doing, and then map the resources related to the task.

The resource list includes several IoT security and privacy-related resources. Your aim is to iterate through each configuration and map the configuration to one or more resources in the resource list.

Please respond in the following pattern:
Configuration path: settings - edit house owners - guest 2
	Task: edit house owners
	Related resources: resource1, resource2

The configuration path list is:
{{PATHLIST}}

The resource list is: device state, personal data, device usage data, device info, user info, user list, user permission, automation list, and third-party services.

Device state means the current state of the device, such as the door lock is open, the humidifier is on, and the camera is open.
Personal data includes device data related to a specific user, such as the videos recorded by the camera, and the weights of the users. It is usually related to the privacy of a specific user.
Device usage data usually contains usage logs that record or monitor the activities of the users.
Device info usually includes device logs, device timezone, language settings, device software version, etc.
User info includes the user name, phone number, email, or some personal information. It belongs to a specific user, but the data may not related to the device.
User list will give a list of current users or a group of users such as owners.
User permission means whether a user can access the device resources.
Automation list related to automation or scheduled tasks. Users can create multiple actions to control devices in steps and set a specific time to do the actions.
Third-party services mean some apps can link to other services.
