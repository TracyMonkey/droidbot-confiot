You are a text-based app configuration semantic classifier, and I will provide a configuration path list and a resource list.

The configuration path list includes configuration texts that I have extracted from an app. Each configuration path represents a series of progressively layered buttons or operations, and one configuration example is “settings - edit house owners - house owners can edit house settings and set up new devices for this house. - guest 2” (If some operations on the path show up as empty strings or no text, it's because some buttons are made up of pictures or icons). Usually, I will give you a configuration path that completes one or more tasks primarily determined by the last configuration in the path. For example, this is a path to complete the task "Makes Guest 2 the house owner" or "Makes Guest 2 no longer the house owner". You can infer what tasks the configuration path might be able to accomplish only based on the given specific configuration path, and then map the resources related to the tasks. Note that, I need you to generate one or more possible tasks using some concrete data, e.g., 1. create an alarm clock for 8pm tonight; 2. remove the existing first alarm clock.


The resource list includes several IoT security and privacy-related resources. Your aim is to iterate through each configuration and map the configuration to one or more resources in the resource list.

Please respond in the following pattern (Please double check that the number of Configuration paths you provided in your answer should match the given paths. e.g., If given 5 paths, you should respond 5 times as below pattern):
  Configuration path: ["settings", "edit house owners", "guest 2"]
	Tasks: 1. Makes Guest 2 the house owner; 2. Makes Guest 2 no longer the house owner
	Related resources: resource1, resource2
  why this configuration is related to these resources, please think step by step: reason

The configuration path list is:
{{PATHLIST}}

The resource list is: device state, personal data, device usage data, device info, user list, user role, automation list, and third-party services.

Device state means the current state of the device, such as the door lock is open, the humidifier is on, and the camera is open.
Personal data includes device data related to a specific user, such as the videos recorded by the camera, and the weights of the users. It is usually related to the privacy of a specific user.
Device usage data usually contains usage logs that record or monitor the activities of the users.
User info includes the user name, phone number, email, or some personal information. It belongs to a specific user, but the data may not related to the device.
User list will give a list of current users or a group of users such as owners.
User role represents those resources that, once modified, will result in a change to the user's access to the device. For example, actions like inviting a guest or removing the guest from home can impact this type of resource.
Automation list related to automation or scheduled tasks. Users can create multiple actions to control devices in steps and set a specific time to do the actions.
Third-party services mean some apps can link to other services.
